Pragyan Rover | Script Guide

Objective:
Control rover movement with sensor-based obstacle handling.

1) Functional blocks
- Motor control (forward, reverse, left, right)
- Distance sensing (ultrasonic/IR)
- Basic navigation decisions
- Telemetry output

2) Starter flow
def move_forward(speed):
    # set motor PWM
    pass

def turn_left(speed):
    # differential motor control
    pass

def avoid_obstacle(distance):
    if distance < 20:
        # stop -> turn -> move
        pass

while True:
    # read sensors
    distance = 100  # replace with actual sensor reading

    if distance < 20:
        avoid_obstacle(distance)
    else:
        move_forward(70)

3) Reuse notes
- Keep movement primitives as reusable functions
- Keep sensor reading logic isolated from navigation decisions
- Reuse rover control loop for autonomous variants
