FPGA Learning Board – 2-bit CPU | Script Guide

Objective:
Build and test a minimal 2-bit CPU on FPGA for learning architecture basics.

1) Project modules
- Program Counter (PC)
- ROM Instruction Memory
- Instruction Decoder
- ALU (2-bit operations)
- Register File
- Top-level integration

2) Suggested build order
- Write and test each module separately
- Create unified testbench with clock/reset
- Validate instruction cycle (fetch -> decode -> execute -> write-back)
- Synthesize and program FPGA board

3) Example pseudo testbench
module cpu_tb;
  reg clk = 0;
  reg rst = 1;
  wire [1:0] out;

  cpu_top dut(.clk(clk), .rst(rst), .out(out));

  always #5 clk = ~clk;

  initial begin
    #20 rst = 0;
    #300 $finish;
  end
endmodule

4) Reuse notes
- Keep opcode map in one header file
- Keep ALU op definitions centralized
- Reuse testbench clock/reset scaffold for larger CPU projects
