Gram Jyoti – Renewable Energy Monitoring | Script Guide

Objective:
Monitor renewable nodes remotely and raise early fault alerts.

1) Data channels
- Voltage
- Current
- Battery temperature
- Power output
- Node uptime

2) Starter flow
def collect_sensor_data():
    # read sensors and return payload
    return {
        "voltage": 0.0,
        "current": 0.0,
        "temperature": 0.0,
        "power": 0.0
    }

def detect_fault(payload):
    # threshold + anomaly logic
    return False

while True:
    data = collect_sensor_data()
    fault = detect_fault(data)

    # TODO: push data to cloud/dashboard
    # TODO: notify mobile app if fault is True

3) Reuse notes
- Keep thresholds in a config file
- Keep notification templates in one place
- Reuse same telemetry schema across IoT projects
